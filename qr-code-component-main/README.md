## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It is _best practice_ to use HTML5 landmarks, such as `header`, `nav`, `main` and `footer` and all html content should be contained in these. Also, level-one headings, i.e. `h1` should always be used.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
